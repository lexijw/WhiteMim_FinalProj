      <h1>Norwegian Culture</h1>
      <div class="my-3">Norway has a rich history dating back to the stone ages, so it is no surprise that the citizens continue to keep the culture of their ancestors alive, while still implementing some new traditions.</div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="ms-3 my-3">Norwegian Food</h2>
        <div class="mt-5 mb-3 me-3">Lamb is the main ingredient in many traditional dishes in Norway. Norwegian goats and cattle also enjoy long outdoor summer holidays by law. In addition, livestock is not given antibiotics, unless an animal is sick.</div>
        <div class="my-3 me-3">The national dish of Norway is Fårikål, which is mutton served atop cabbage. It is usually served during the fall and the winter as a hearty dish to keep natives warm.</div>
        <div class="my-3 me-3">Waffles - called vafler in Norway - are also a popular and beloved dish in the country. They are usually shaped like hearts, which allows people to tear a slice off and eat it with jam or cream.</div>
        <div class="my-3 me-3">Another Norwegian staple - sometimes served atop vafler, is brunost, a brown cheese made with a mixture of cow and goats milk. It has a rich caramel taste with a slight hint of sharpness. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="mt-3">Norwegian Music and Dance</h2>
        <div class="my-3">Folk music is the primary genre in Norway, from traditional vocal folk music to the newer instrunmental folk.</div>
        <div class="my-3">The native Sami people of Norway invented a vocal folk music called joik, which has been widely beloved through Norway. The only instrument it uses is a Shami drum called the runebomme.</div>
        <div class="my-3">The Halling dance, or hallingdansen in Norwegian, is a traditional folk dance usually performed by men at special occasions such as weddings. It has been adapted in the past to include women, making it a partner dance performed at many museums and historical tourism spots to showcase the traditional Norwegian culture.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <div id="artDiv">
        <h2 class="mt-3">Norwegian Art</h2>
          <img src="/Images/thescream.jpg" class="w-25 float-end">
        <div class="my-3">Possibly the most famous artist to come from Norway is Edvard Munch, painter of the famous image "The Scream". Some other notable artists that came form Norway are Johan Christian Dahl, Hans Fredrik Gude and Frits Thaulow.</div>
        <div class="my-3">The first noteable art form in Norway comes from the Viking Age, when Vikings would combine practicality with creativity by painting or decorating functional items. It is known from written evidence that Vikings would also weave intricate tapestries, but there is nothing in Norwegian museums that survived the time from that era due to 
          cloth and fabric items degrading.</div>
        <div class="my-3">Norway also homes a widely popular form of art called folk art, which is used less to paint canvases than to paint other home decoration items such as trunks, bowls, vases and even walls or doors. The most widely recognized style of folk art is rosemaling, or rose painting.
        This style uses floral patterns and designs, making it recognizable and distinct from other art styles. </div>
        <div class="my-3">Another widely popular and noteable art form in Norway is rock carving. This art form dates back to the stone age, when the first men would carve petroglyphs (rock carvings) or pictographs (rock paintings) as a way to communicate between generations.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="w-100"></div>
      <h2 class="mt-3">Leisure Activities</h2>
      <img src="/Images/norwayskiing.jpg" class="w-50 d-block mx-auto">
      <div class="my-3">Norway is a great place to go camping due to their law of allemannsretten, which means the right to roam. Essentially, in Norway you can set up a tent for one night on any property as long as you are a certain distance away from the inhabitants 
        buildings. There are also designated campsites thorughout the country for those looking to stay for longer, but the right to roam law allows people to explore the country on foot.</div>
      <div class="my-3">Another popular Norwegian activity is hiking, and the country has the perfect landscape for it with rocky mountains and deep valleys. Hiking trails are marked with cairns, or rock towers, throughout the country.</div>
      <div class="mt-3 mb-5">Also thanks to its landscape and climate, Norway is said to be the home of skiing. A rock carving from 4000 years ago is said to be the first recorded image of skiing in the world, so it is no surprise that locals and visitors alike
        choose Norway as a ski destination.</div>
