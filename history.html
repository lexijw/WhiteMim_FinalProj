          <h5 class="float-end ms-2">700AD</h5>
          The Vikings are a large part of the history of Norway and many Scandinavian countries. Vikings were some of the first people to settle in Norway, 
          first in small communities where they began to farm. From about the seventh century to the ninth, Vikings ruled the waters around Norway.

        <div class="ms-lg-auto col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-start me-2">700-900AD</h5>
          Further inland, artifacts of previous settlements have been found, which can be distinguished from those of the Vikings to those of the hunters and farmers. 
          Once farming became more widespread, the legions of hunters and fishermen came second.
        </div>        
        <div class="col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-end ms-2">1000AD</h5>
          After the Viking age, near the 11th century, once Norway became a monarchy, it was not unusual to see several kings. The country saw more religious expansion with the rule of 
          the three sons of Magnus III. The three kings continued to develop monasteries and cathedrals in the area, ultimately leading to civil unrest due to the increased power of 
          governing bodies such as the monarchy and the church.
        </div>        
        <div class="ms-lg-auto col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-start me-2">1000-1100AD</h5>
          The civil war started around 1000 BC and was based on the unclarity of the righteous heirs to the throne, as no concrete succession laws were in place. 
          The battle for power lasted approximately 100 years until King Haakon IV took the throne and passed a new succession law that ended the fight for power.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-end ms-2">1300-1500AD</h5>
          Norway has had a long history with its neighboring countries, Sweden and Denmark, beginning with the Kalmar Union in 1397. The Kalmar Union, where the three countries united 
          under one king, ended in 1523 when Sweden left the Union. Norway was still under the rule of Denmark at this time, until 1814, when Norway finally won its fight for freedom 
          and refused Denmark as its governing state.
        </div>
        <div class="ms-lg-auto col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-start me-2">1550AD</h5>
          Later that year, however, Sweden attacked Norway and entered a union with the country. Norway had more freedom within this Union, though, where it was still ruled by the 
          king of Sweden but had its internal government and final say for the use of its army.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 position-relative my-lg-0 my-md-3 my-sm-3">
          <h5 class="float-end ms-2">1900AD</h5>
          Despite this, Norway still fought for the right to govern its own country entirely. It succeeded in 1905 when it elected King Haakon VII to the throne, 
          effectively dissolving its Union with Sweden.
